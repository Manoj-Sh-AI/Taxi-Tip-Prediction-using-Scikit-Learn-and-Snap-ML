# Taxi-Tip-Prediction-using-Scikit-Learn-and-Snap-ML
Predicting taxi tips is an important task for taxi drivers and companies as it can help them optimize their services and increase their revenue. Scikit-Learn is a popular open-source machine learning library in Python, and Snap ML is a high-performance machine learning library from IBM designed for large-scale datasets.

Using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML, it is possible to build accurate and efficient taxi tip prediction models. The process typically involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, transformation, and normalization. Feature engineering is the process of selecting and creating features that can improve the performance of the model. Model training involves selecting a suitable algorithm and optimizing its parameters using a training dataset. Evaluation is carried out using a test dataset to measure the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Scikit-Learn offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector regression, among others. Snap ML, on the other hand, is designed to handle large-scale datasets using parallel and distributed computing techniques, making it ideal for big data applications.

Overall, using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML, taxi tip prediction models can be built with high accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. By predicting tips accurately, taxi drivers and companies can optimize their services, increase their revenue, and improve customer satisfaction.
